This repository contains a Python-based face detection project leveraging a pre-trained model from Google Teachable Machine. It offers an easy-to-implement solution for detecting faces in images and video streams using machine learning techniques.

# Features
- Detects faces in images and in real-time too.
- Utilizes a pre-trained model from Google Teachable Machine.
- Beginner-friendly and easy to customize.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library

-Installlation of facefinder+ 
-Step1: Open chrome and search for Google Teachable Machines website(https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and click on Get started.
